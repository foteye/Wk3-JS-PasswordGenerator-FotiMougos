Homework Week 3 - Password Generator<br>
Author: Foti Mougos<br>

### Brief:
The customer would like a secure password to be generated when a 'Generate Password' button is clicked. They would like to be prompted for input criteria (as opposed to using a defined standard or ... y'know, form). These criteria include:

  * Length (8 - 128 characters)
  * Character Types (Lower, Upper, Number, Symbol) (at least one should be selected per customer requirements, is this 1994? all should be selected!!)
  * Password should be displayed somewhere either in alert or on page

All input should be validated.

Considerations should be made about responsiveness to window scaling & standard sensible styling (make pretty)

Some wise words: "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."
